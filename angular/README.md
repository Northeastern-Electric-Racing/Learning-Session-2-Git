### ANGULAR LEARNING SESSION

HELLO FOLKS!! Today we will be learning all about ANGULAR

Hopefully you have reviewed the slides because those will be very helpful for you here

### Your Task

We are implementing a ticket management and display system, we are using the rxjs library to manage the state of the managed tickets.

Run `npm install` inside the `ticket_manager` directory

You may have to use sudo if your getting permission denied errors

A quick guide to the folders

- [ ] `app` Contains our app.module.ts file which hosts the declarations of our components and the entry point of the application
- [ ] `components` Contains all of the components for the application
- [ ] `pages` Contains the major pages of the application
- [ ] `services` Contains all of our models and injectables 
- [ ] `utils` Our types and utility functions

To start the app run `ng serve`

You will notice that there is nothing there 

If you look in the pages folder and into the ticket-list componet ts file, you will see alot of comments, these are your tasks. 

As you complete the tasks you will be able to add and remove tickets and have them dynamically update in the task list file.

You will be completed once you are able to add remove and view individual tickets through the routing module.

Refer to the slides for completing the tasks, examples are provided for all of them.

Resolve all comments in...
- [ ] app-routing.module.ts
- [ ] ticket-list.component.html
- [ ] ticket-list.component.ts
- [ ] ticket-view.component.ts
- [ ] ticket-view.component.html

GOOD LUCK!
